<div><p>Learning your child has autism can be deeply troubling and rock one at their core. The present day sentiment is that it's not really a problem: many people are simply not aware that Autism Spectrum Disorder is something privalent. Unfortunately, this leads many parents to imagine themselves immune to the problem--that if you do everything right during pregnancy, you're child will be come into this world free of any difficulties and grow freely. The truth is that child can develop ASD and it is well understood that some children with ASD will require much upfront attention in the development years. No child with ASD is like another.</p>

<h3>What kind of "attention" do children with ASD need?</h3>
<p>Early Intervention: Children with ASD will begin to show signs immediately after birth. Some will begin to show signs in the following months. As parents, we know our children and at a certain point a parent can begin to question certain behaviors or lack there of as a sign of <i>something</i> being wrong. Though it is possible nothing is wrong, there is no reason not to set up an assessment to see if the child is in need for Early Intervention. Programs vary from state to state but children may be eligible to receive free at-home care until the age of 3, after which they can be enrolled in Pre-k.</p>

<p>Advocation: Children with autism may not be able to communicate with other children or adults. One of the first things one has to learn as a parent is to be an advocate for your child. Many parents find this easy, others something that requires some practice. In either case, aim to convey a clear message as polite as possible but also remain resolute: often accommedations are only made after continued advocacy.</p>

<p>This page is a little bit hommage to the internet of yesterday year and a little bit outreach for those who find themselves in a similar situation. I hope this evolves into something worth while, something great but only time will tell.</p>

<p>Before you set off clicking away remember that not all is lost and there is hope. Depending on your situation, it may not be as dire as you imagine. Autism is a spectrum and that variability should be welcomed. It means you'll need to study your child. What I post here should help you with that. Most children don't need to be studied: their essence hangs on the outside. Children with autism require a bit of digging. Please dig.</p></div>
